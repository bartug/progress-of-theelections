# Story-Based Game - React Native for Android and iOS

This project is a **story-based game** developed for both Android and iOS using **React Native**. It features a dynamic narrative where the choices made by users influence the storyline, with additional AI-powered visual elements and modern technologies.

## Features

- **Story-Based Choices**: User decisions affect the flow of the game and are remembered across sessions.
- **Firebase Integration**: User data is securely stored using **Firebase**.
- **Google Authentication**: Users can easily sign up and log in via their Google accounts.
- **Push Notifications**: Timely notifications are sent to users through Firebase.
- **AI-Generated Visuals**: Background images for each chapter are dynamically generated by **artificial intelligence** based on the chapter ID.
- **Chapter Management**: Each chapter has a unique `chapterId` that dynamically loads its corresponding content and background.

## Technologies and Tools

- **React Native**: A cross-platform framework for building Android and iOS applications.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication, data storage, and push notifications.
  - **Firebase Authentication**: Enables Google sign-in.
  - **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Sends push notifications to users.
  - **Firebase Firestore**: Stores user data and game progress.
- **Google API**: Utilized for Google login and user authentication.
- **AI-Powered Content**: Background visuals are AI-generated for each chapter.
- **React Navigation**: Handles navigation between screens within the app.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bartug/progress-of-theelections.git


Install Dependencies:

cd progress-of-theelections
npm install

Firebase Configuration:
Create a firebaseConfig.js file and configure it with your Firebase project credentials. This will be used for Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Messaging.

Platform-Specific Setup:

    Android:

    bash

npx react-native run-android

iOS:

bash

        cd ios
        pod install
        cd ..
        npx react-native run-ios

Usage

    Google Login: Users can log in using their Google accounts when they launch the app.
    Chapter Selection: As users progress, AI-generated background visuals are loaded based on the chapter ID.
    Persistent Choices: User choices are stored in Firebase, allowing the game to remember decisions across sessions.
    Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send periodic notifications about story updates or new chapters.

AI-Generated Visuals

Each chapter's background image is dynamically created by artificial intelligence based on the chapterId. This enhances the uniqueness of each chapter's appearance and storyline immersion.
